## Event time and Resting Period
The JKU Games 2025S will take place from **Friday, 02.05. (16:00)** until **Sunday, 04.05. (06:00)**, for 38 hours 
non-stop.<br>
On Saturday from **04:00 to 10:00**, the JKU Games Orga team will have a **resting period** and operate at limited 
capacity. We'll use this time to clean up and prepare the next day, and might even catch an hour of sleep or two as 
well. <br>
During this time, you can stay at the event and play games, but you won't be able to get new ones from our Games Rental 
section. Our Infopoint will be staffed, but outages in our technical infrastructure might not be fixed as quickly. In 
other words: This is the perfect time to test our resting area or work on our giant puzzle.

### Beamster (Kepler Building) - Friday, 9.30pm
<em>Gotcha!</em><br>
This Lasertag App was developed at JKU from a Master AI Student. It easily enables you to play Lasertag with only your 
phone - to see how it works just go on their [website](https://www.beamster.com/), and you will quickly learn to love it. 
The developer itself will host the tournament which will be held in a Team-Deathmatch like setting.<br>

### Blobby Volley (LAN Area) - Saturday, 1am
<em>Volleyball, but with green, slimy blobs - i.e. the perfect past-midnight game and all-time classic at the Games.</em><br>
We will play in a bracket system in an epic battle to the death.<br>
If you are confused why you have never heard of this game, it was a bit more popular back in the Windows XP days.
The necessary software will therefore be pre-installed on the tournament computers.

### UNO Flip! (Dice Area) - Saturday, 4pm
<em>UNO, but they accidentally printed both sides of the cards. It's the classical game, but with a little twist (or 
dare I say "Flip"?)</em><br>
We will play in a bracket system consisting of several groups playing each other. First to get rid of their cards 
advances to the next round.<br>
We will provide you with the game (and rules).

### Phase10 (Dice Area) - Saturday, 5.30pm
<em>Prepare for a game of wits, luck, and strategic card play in the Phase 10 Tournament! Will you advance swiftly 
through the phases, or be left scrambling to catch up?</em><br>

### Minecraft Hunger Games (LAN Area) - Saturday, 8pm
<em>Happy Hunger Games! And may the odds be ever in your favour.</em><br>
In the world of Minecraft Hunger Games, there’s only one rule: survive. Gather resources, set traps, and fight for your 
life as you 
go up against other players with the same goal. But beware — the arena is unforgiving, and only the best will emerge 
victorious! 
Do you have what it takes to be the last one standing?<br>
Three rounds will be played. In the first two rounds, the top half of players will advance to the next round. The final 
round will determine the winner of the tournament.<br>

on our network.

It is Poker, is there anything else to say? (Obviously we don't play with real stakes)

### Staring Contest (Dice Area) - Sunday, 2am
<em>Especially enticing for all that have stayed up throughout the whole event, this game will force you to stay awake.</em><br>
In this bracket style tournament, you will be invited to get lost in your opponents eyes. If you blink, you lose!<br>
Please bring the necessary eyes.

## Async Tournaments

### Chess Champion
<em>Make Magnus proud in this async tournament!</em><br>
In light of logistical considerations regarding space and scheduling, we have devised a unique tournament format. The 
tournament will span the entire event, and each participant will receive three buttons identifying them as a 
<em>Challenger.</em><br>Participants possessing a <em>Challenger</em> button can be challenged to a chess duel at any 
time during the event. Upon the conclusion of a match, the defeated player will surrender one of their buttons to the 
victor. The tournament concludes for a player when they have no buttons remaining. Alternatively, if a participant 
wishes to conclude their challenge period before running out of buttons, they can return their remaining buttons to the 
Games Rental section and only then the score will be recorded for evaluation at the conclusion of the tournament.<br>
The announcement of the tournament winner is scheduled for 12am (midnight) on Sunday. In case that a winner is no longer
present at the JKU Games location, we will contact them to convey their victory.<br>
We look forward to an exciting and competitive chess tournament during the JKU Games!

### Speed-Puzzle Challenge
<em>You have as many tries as you want, but only one can be the fastest.</em><br>
The quickest one to solve our 49 pieces JKU GAMES SS25-Puzzle will be awarded the title of "JKU GAMES SS25 Puzzle 
Champion" as well as this year's jigsaw puzzle itself.<br>
That's really all there is to say about it. The challenge will be available at the games rental desk from Friday 4pm 
till Sunday 12am (midnight). After that we will contact the final record time holder and make sure you receive your prize.<br>
During the Event we will keep you updated about the current record time in the "speed-puzzle-challenge" text channel on 
our discord.

## Promoted Games
During the event, we will promote specific games at specific times to help you find players and opponents. You can find 
them in the [LAN](/./lan) and [DICE](/./dice) area respectively.<br>
Promoted games (as all tournaments seen above) will also receive their own Discord event, so make sure to join our 
<a href="{{ site.discord_url }}" target="_blank">Discord server</a> and mark yourself interested: This way, you will 
always receive a notification when a new game starts.
