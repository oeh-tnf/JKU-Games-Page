## Promoted Games

During the JKU Games, we want to promote a few games at specific timeslots. Mainly focused on the LAN section, this should help make it feel more coherent and communal. Furthermore, it makes finding allies and opponents to play with easier.<br>
Games that are promoted have been decided in a community vote. Each will be promoted for a four-hour timeslot:

| Start time | Game              |
| ---------- | ----------------- |
| Fr 19:00   | CS:GO / Valorant  |
| Sa 18:00   | League of Legends |

## Two Rooms and a Boom

This group game will have you protect the president, assassinate him, or sow chaos doing an entirely different task. Of course, not knowing the roles of others, being split up into two rooms without means of communication, and having people sent back and forth between them does not make succeeding any simpler. That's why communication is key.<br>
Two Rooms and a Boom will be played on Friday starting at 19:00 in the Group Games room, where you will get a more in-depth explanation of the rules and roles.
After that, new rounds will start approximately every half hour until 22:30.

## Werewolf

Werewolves are hiding in the peaceful village and are trying to eat all its residents, but the villagers won't just let them do as they please. Meanwhile, some are scheming entirely different plans in secret to use the chaos to their advantage. The question is, can you trust others and their claims of who and what they are?<br>
Werewolf is played almost constantly in the Group Games room, where you will get a more in-depth explanation of the rules and roles.
New rounds are planned to start every full hour (unless the room is needed otherwise) and will be announced via <a href="{{ site.discord_url }}">Discord</a> in the werewolf channel.

## Game Store 

During the JKU Games the Game Store Linz will hold Magic the Gathering Events in the Dice Area.<br>
This is their schedule:

| Start time | Tournament       |
| ---------- | -----------------|
| Fr to Sa   | On Demand Drafts	        |
