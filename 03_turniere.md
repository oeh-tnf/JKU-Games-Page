## Event time and Resting Period
The JKU Games 2024S will take place from **Friday, 17.05. (16:00)** until **Sunday, 19.05. (06:00)**, for 38 hours non-stop.<br>
On Saturday from **04:00 to 10:00**, the JKU Games Orga team will have a **resting period** and operate at limited capacity. We'll use this time to clean up and prepare the next day, and might even catch an hour of sleep or two as well. <br>
During this time, you can stay at the event and play games but you won't be able to get new ones from our Games Rental section. Our Infopoint will be staffed, but outages in our technical infrastructure might not be fixed as quickly. In other words: This is the perfect time to test our resting area or work on our giant puzzle.

## Async Tournaments

### Chess Champion
<em>Make Magnus proud in this async tournament!</em><br>
In light of logistical considerations regarding space and scheduling, we have devised a unique tournament format. The tournament will span 
the entire event, and each participant will receive three buttons identifying them as a <em>Challenger.</em><br>
Participants possessing a <em>Challenger</em> button can be challenged to a chess duel at any time during the event. 
Upon the conclusion of a match, the defeated player will surrender one of their buttons to the victor. The tournament concludes 
for a player when they have no buttons remaining. Alternatively, if a participant wishes to conclude their challenge period 
before running out of buttons, they can return their remaining buttons to the Games Rental section and only then the score will 
be recorded for evaluation at the conclusion of the tournament.<br>
The announcement of the tournament winner is scheduled for 12am (midnight) on Sunday. In case that a winner is no longer present 
at the JKU Games location, we will contact them to convey their victory.<br>
We look forward to an exciting and competitive chess tournament during the JKU Games!

### Speed-Puzzle Challenge
<em>You have as many tries as you want, but only one can be the fastest.</em><br>
The quickest one to solve our 49 pieces JKU GAMES SS24-Puzzle will be awarded the title of "JKU GAMES SS24 Puzzle Champion" as well as this year's jigsaw puzzle itself.<br>
That's really all there is to say about it. The challenge will be available at the games rental desk from Friday 4pm till Sunday 12am (midnight). After that we will contact the final record time holder and make sure you receive your prize.<br>
During the Event we will keep you updated about the current record time in the "speed-puzzle-challenge" text channel on our discord.

## Promoted Games
During the event, we will promote specific games at specific times to help you find players and opponents. You can find them in the [LAN](/./lan) and [DICE](/./dice) area respectively.<br>
Promoted games (as all tournaments seen above) will also receive their own Discord event, so make sure to join our <a href="{{ site.discord_url }}">Discord server</a> and mark yourself interested: This way, you will always receive a notification when a new game starts.
