## Highlights of the LAN-Area
* Room for up to 100 PCs
* An ever-growing <!-- VR- and -->Console-Area
* Try new games in the Game Dev Area

We usually have enough space for all PC players, so you do not need to reserve a place. Still, if you want to make absolutely 
sure that you are not transporting your 50kg machine here in vain, you can grab a free reservation below. People that have reserved a spot will be prioritized if spots run out.

## Promoted Games
During the JKU Games, we want to promote a few games in the LAN section at specific timeslots. This should help make it feel more coherent and communal. 
Furthermore, it makes finding allies and opponents to play with easier.<br>
Each game will be promoted for a four-hour timeslot. This is the planned schedule:

| Start time | Game              |
| ---------- | ----------------- |
| Fr 17:00   | League of Legends |
| Fr 21:00   | Valorant          |
| Fr 23:00   | Among Us          |
| Sa 17:00   | Counter-Strike    |
| Sa 21:00   | Overwatch         |
| Sa 23:00   | Among Us          |

## To Bring
* We provide you with all the infrastructure, e.g. LAN cable, tables etc.
* You have to bring your own PC and gaming equipment!
* Make sure to install large games you plan on playing beforehand to limit the strain on our infrastructure.
* Your own powerstrip (Verteiler) might come in handy as well.
* No need to bring anything for our <!-- VR- and -->Console-Area.
