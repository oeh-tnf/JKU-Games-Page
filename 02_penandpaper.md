| Description      | Victorian London, 1855. <br>A year has passed since you and your companions unraveled a grim case of illness, death, and conspiracy. Your investigative talents, highly praised by the press, have not gone unnoticed. A cryptic letter from a solicitor reaches you, urging your presence at Addington Palace. You are tasked with safeguarding a priceless inheritance during the proceedings following the death of the esteemed aristocrat, Margaret Mallan. Drawn in by curiosity, you soon find yourself at the heart of a complex criminal investigation—one filled with the hunt for clues, intense interrogations, sharp deductions, and, ultimately, delivering justice to those who deserve it. <br><br>Note: this is a soft sequel to my adventure "The Green Death" I previously ran at 3 past JKU Games. The plot is not connected to the old adventure, but it follows the same playable characters. Both new and returning players are welcome! |

| Description  | A highly narrative swashbuckling adventure in which a Prince fleeing from a coup and his heroic allies and companions find a way to take back their country from the clutches of the coup that ousted them. <br>This is the quickstart adventure for 7th Sea 2nd Edition: If you enjoy Pirates of the Carribean-esque (just without the pirates) action in a Golden Age of Sailing setting, all within Fantasy Europe, this is your kind of game. Just a fair warning upfront that this oneshot is set up to be very linear in structure; there is not much room to change the direction that it goes. It should be seen more as an extended trailer because it is not a complete adventure, just two scenes from a bigger story. Also be aware that this system is highly narrative (so those enjoying a crunchy experience may not be at home here); there is little in the way of deep combat mechanics or intricate stats, and the system expects a high amount of player improv to solve the situation in front of them. |

| Description      | A dark lighthouse on a stormy night leads to a foregone conclusion. The ship you were travelling on crashes against the rocks and is not going to make it to your original destination - neither will your lifeboat in these conditions. You are making your way to the lightless beacon to shelter from the storm and to find out what led to the lighthouse to go dark. |

| Description      | Ein exzentrischer Erfinder lädt eine Gruppe von Abenteurern ein, ein bahnbrechendes magisches Tauchgerät zu testen. Ihre Aufgabe: in die Tiefen hinabzusteigen und der Quelle einer seltsamen Störung unter den Wellen auf den Grund zu gehen. Doch je tiefer sie tauchen und je dunkler es wird, desto stärker verschwimmt die Grenze zwischen Entdeckung und Gefahr. |

| Description  | A highly narrative swashbuckling adventure in which a Prince fleeing from a coup and his heroic allies and companions find a way to take back their country from the clutches of the coup that ousted them. <br>This is the quickstart adventure for 7th Sea 2nd Edition: If you enjoy Pirates of the Carribean-esque (just without the pirates) action in a Golden Age of Sailing setting, all within Fantasy Europe, this is your kind of game. Just a fair warning upfront that this oneshot is set up to be very linear in structure; there is not much room to change the direction that it goes. It should be seen more as an extended trailer because it is not a complete adventure, just two scenes from a bigger story. Also be aware that this system is highly narrative (so those enjoying a crunchy experience may not be at home here); there is little in the way of deep combat mechanics or intricate stats, and the system expects a high amount of player improv to solve the situation in front of them. |

| Description      | Ein Investor mit gutem Blick hat einen Geistesblitz als er von einem Ooze in der Gegend hörte. Er glaubt fest daran, dass die Sekrete des Ooze der Schlüssel für den Durchbruch in seinem Experiment sei, weswegen er euch dazu anheuert ihm Proben zu holen. Doch es haben anscheinend auch andere ihren Blick auf den Ooze geworfen. |

| Description      | In der Welt von HeXXen1733 verlief alles so, wie ihr es aus dem Geschichtsunterricht kanntet, zumindest bis zum 30-jährigem Krieg. In einer verhängnisvollen Nacht wurde ein Portal zur Hölle im Schwarzwald geöffnet und zahlreiche Dämonen schlüpften hervor. Doch die Kreaturen sind nicht nur in Mitteleuropa erwacht. Auf der ganzen Welt treiben sich nun Wesen herum, die man zuvor nur aus Märchen, Erzählungen oder Horrorgeschichten kannte. <br>Aber die Menschheit steht den Kreaturen nicht schutzlos gegenüber. Zahlreiche Menschen nehmen die Waffen im Kampf gegen das Böse auf und kämpfen mit Glauben und Stahl, die sogenannten Jäger. <br>In Dämonenbrut feiert ihr in einem Gasthaus in einer Großstadt nach einer erfolgreichen Jagd. Als ihr danach auf euren Zimmern ausruht seht ihr plötzlich etwas ungewöhnliches vor eurem Fenster. |

| Description      | In der Welt von HeXXen1733 verlief alles so, wie ihr es aus dem Geschichtsunterricht kanntet, zumindest bis zum 30-jährigem Krieg. In einer verhängnisvollen Nacht wurde ein Portal zur Hölle im Schwarzwald geöffnet und zahlreiche Dämonen schlüpften hervor. Doch die Kreaturen sind nicht nur in Mitteleuropa erwacht. Auf der ganzen Welt treiben sich nun Wesen herum, die man zuvor nur aus Märchen, Erzählungen oder Horrorgeschichten kannte. <br>Aber die Menschheit steht den Kreaturen nicht schutzlos gegenüber. Zahlreiche Menschen nehmen die Waffen im Kampf gegen das Böse auf und kämpfen mit Glauben und Stahl, die sogenannten Jäger. <br>In Geplagte Seelen verfolgt ihr eine Räuberbande quer durch die deutschen Lande. Ihr habt deren Spur bis zu einem Bauernhof verfolgt, doch dort scheint nicht alles nach Rechten Dingen zuzugehen. |
