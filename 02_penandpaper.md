| Rulebook | Monster of the Week - this is a lightweight Pen and Paper game which was inspired by short but effective horror stories; especially by Supernatural. Normally this is the setting, our modern world. We however, will not play in a modern setting, but a slightly modified version which takes place in a high fantasy medieval world similar to The Witcher.  |
| Level | Any (Beginner friendly)  |
| Description | It is Autumn 1471. The leaves began changing their colour a few weeks ago, the weather reminds you of the harsh winter ahead. Fog engulfs the land as you wake up in the carriage you spent the night in. Your party and you had had a few exciting hunts lately and as you caught word that Kudóvice, a small village, cried out for help, you could not stop yourself. The merchant who told you about the distress happily took you with him in his old wagon as he headed there himself. |

| Description | Strolling through the library of Candlekeep you stumble across a mysterious book with an inset mirror. What will you find between those pages? And could it have something to do with the acolyte, that has gone missing? This Oneshot is roleplay focused, but of course you are not going to miss out on a boss fight in the end. On the way there there is quite a bit of mystery to figure out and some inner beauty to find.|

TW: This adventure will deal with occultism and blood. |

As the death toll and suffering increases, the strange outbreak defying well-established medical knowledge gets even more mysterious as the prime investigator of the Royal Hospital suddenly disappears. The players act as private investigators in a dark Victorian setting and are tasked with figuring out if there is more than nature alone at play here. Note that the focus of this adventure more on the story, mystery and role-playing rather than on combat and constant skill checks. |

### 15:00

| Adventure | Goblin Heist  |
|---|---|
| Language |  German/English |
| Game-Master |  Daniel (@Kuta1999#2531) |
| Rulebook | D&D 5e |
| Level | Any (Beginner friendly)  |
| Description | The fair city of Shallowsea is truly the jewel of the Rapier Coast. It's the home of fancy noble families, wealthy merchant guilds, grand fleets, bright festivals... and the infamous Goblin Mafia. One of the local Gobsters (goblin mobster, get it? Uhh, anyway...) One of the local crime bosses, Clever Tony, has devised another one of those treacherous schemes he's known for. However, he will need to hire an elite team of gobbo specialists to pull it off successfully. That's where you enter the picture. This one-shot may or may not be based on a meme i once saw. Whitout doubt, it does not take itself all too seriously. However, do not let that deceive you; you will need plenty of wit, charm, sneakiness and stabbiness to succeed. (The game is a bit silly, but it should still offer a decent gameplay challange.)|
