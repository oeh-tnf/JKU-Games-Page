| Level | Any (Beginner friendly)  |
| Description | The city of Silverymoon celebrates the 5th anniversary of putting down the rebellion uprising. However, not everything is as peaceful as it seems, as there is a murder mystery to solve amidst the celebrations! Murder Mystery, so don't expect too much combat.  |
| Players | 2-5 players |
| Duration | 2-5 hours |
| Characters | Characters are created on site. The rules should be simple enough that characters can be created quickly before the game. (You can bring a pregenerated d&d 5e character of 1st level if you want just in case we use that) |

And could it have something to do with the acolyte, that has gone missing? This Oneshot is roleplay focused, but of course you are not going to miss out on a boss fight in the end. On the way there there is quite a bit of mystery to figure out and some inner beauty to find.|

| Language |  German/English |
| Game-Master |  Max (@MinerMax555#0422) |
| Rulebook | D&D 5e |
| Level | Any (Beginner friendly)  |
| Description | 1854. Cholera, a truly terrible curse, is haunting London. As the death toll and suffering increases, the strange outbreak defying well-established medical knowledge gets even more mysterious as the prime investigator of the Royal Hospital suddenly disappears. The players act as private investigators in a dark Victorian setting and are tasked with figuring out if there is more than nature alone at play here. Note that the focus of this adventure more on the story, mystery and role-playing rather than on combat and constant skill checks. |
| Players | up to 5 players |
| Duration | 4-5 hours |
| Characters | choose from pre-made characters or create a custom character before starting |

### 15:00

| Adventure | Goblin Heist  |
|---|---|
| Language |  German/English |
| Game-Master |  Daniel (@Kuta1999#2531) |
| Rulebook | D&D 5e |
| Level | Any (Beginner friendly)  |
| Description | The fair city of Shallowsea is truly the jewel of the Rapier Coast. It's the home of fancy noble families, wealthy merchant guilds, grand fleets, bright festivals... and the infamous Goblin Mafia. One of the local Gobsters (goblin mobster, get it? Uhh, anyway...) One of the local crime bosses, Clever Tony, has devised another one of those treacherous schemes he's known for. However, he will need to hire an elite team of gobbo specialists to pull it off successfully. That's where you enter the picture. This one-shot may or may not be based on a meme i once saw. Whitout doubt, it does not take itself all too seriously. However, do not let that deceive you; you will need plenty of wit, charm, sneakiness and stabbiness to succeed. (The game is a bit silly, but it should still offer a decent gameplay challange.)|
