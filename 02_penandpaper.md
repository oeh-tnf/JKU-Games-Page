| Description | It’s the year 1884, but things are different from what you read in history books. Folks from all over the world journey to the American frontier looking for opportunity, freedom, and open spaces. But danger awaits. Evil is rising in the Wild West. Some say there are more than just wild animals on those lonely trails. Some say there are monsters, created from our deepest fears and brought to life by a powerful evil. Most people think this is just superstitious nonsense — stories told around the campfire to scare children. But you know better. Out here, the nights feel darker, the distance between towns seems longer, and something changes the land itself. You have seen the evil, faced it, and even survived. Maybe you have made it your mission to protect the innocent people of the West from this evil. Or maybe you’re drawn to fame and fortune, risking your life time and again against what waits in the shadows. Or maybe it’s just the excitement of the hunt, knowing you’re facing things others think are just stories. Whatever your reason, you and a few like-minded people have found yourselves on Heath Crittenden's farm, a few miles southeast of Heaston Hill in Uinta County, Wyoming. At first, you were just looking for a hot meal and a place to rest on your way to town. But when Heath tells you that something is killing his cattle and that the Ghost Steel gang is causing trouble, plus one of his farm workers has been killed under strange circumstances, it sparks your sense of adventure... |

| Description | There is no fear as your life is fading away. You feel an unexpected comfort in the arms of the being that is taking your life. You experience a surprising calm as it all disappears. Drop by drop, it takes your fears, your worries, your dreams, your joy. - Then, your conscience vanishes, and all that’s left is blackness. - You open your eyes. There is a lingering feeling that something is missing, but something else immediately overrides it. It is an electric purr that stirs your senses awake. Coming back from Death is slow. You feel sluggish as you become aware of the room you are in, the company you share. Above and around you are slow swinging hunks of meat, like the bodies of that deathly migration. Beside you are others, also escaping Death’s shore. As you begin to sit up, you feel it for the first time: Hunger. And you know, somehow, as you experience the terrible pangs of this Hunger, that you are no longer human. -This is an introductory oneshot to Vampire the Masquerade, a system about personal and political horror where you play vampires in the modern world. As such, expect sensitive subject matter.|

| Description | The salt jungle has hidden many old ruins and forgotten treasures, but now a new rumour is spreading. A literal city of gold has supposedly been found. Even among the enlightened pupulace of the surrounding area, this lead to a gold rush. But there are several problems with this. For one, the danger of the area means that only experienced adventurers even have a chance. Secondly an enchantment around the city ensures that anyone can only ever find the city once, making not just repeat visits, but also guides an impossibility. And lastly, most that have visited the city simply pocketed the riches and fled the country rather return it to the nobles that organised the trip. This is where you come in: As part of a bet of who can retrieve the biggest treasure, a group of nobles each found an adventurer (you) that is not interested in the riches at all and will dutifully return the gold to them as part of the newest expedition.|
