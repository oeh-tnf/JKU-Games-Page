We are a group of students from the technical faculty branch of the student union (ÖH TNF), who love to play games. 
In order to share this passion with others at JKU, we are organizing the JKU Games, a free gaming event that takes place 
almost every semester. We can't take all the credit however, as this event builds on the experience and work of all the 
organizers before us (after all, this is the 21th edition). Also, such an event would not be possible without so many 
other ÖH TNF members and friends supporting us during the event.

## Got some spare time?
Are you a talented Game-Master looking to host a few games? Do you have an idea for the perfect tournament we are 
missing and want to organize it? Are you a huge fan of LAN cables and want to share your expertise? Would you like to 
help us at the event with smaller tasks at the Infopoint, Games Rental, etc.?

We are always happy for your support!<br>
