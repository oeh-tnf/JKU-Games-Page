We are a group of students from the technical faculty branch of the student union (ÖH TNF), who love to play games. In order to share this passion with others at JKU, we are organizing the JKU Games, a free gaming event that takes place almost every semester. We can't take all the credit however, as this event builds on the experience and work of all the organizers before us (after all, this is the 18th edition). Also, such an event would not be possible without so many other ÖH TNF members and friends supporting us during the event.

## Safety- and Awareness Team
If you don't feel comfortable because of a specific person or about a certain situation in our control, you can inform the awareness contact below. We will handle your request confidentially and bring up your problem anonymously with other relevant members of the Orga Team if necessary. We will then try to sort the issue out as quickly as possible.


## Got some spare time?
Are you a talented Game-Master looking to host a few games? Do you have an idea for the perfect tournament we are missing and want to organize it? Are you a huge fan of LAN cables and want to share your expertise? Would you like to help us at the event with smaller tasks at the Infopoint, Games Rental, etc.?

We are always happy for your support!<br>
If you can assist us at the event, simply hit us up via [games@oeh.jku.at](mailto:games@oeh.jku.at)!

If you are thinking about joining your student union and organising events like this more regularly (among many other interesting jobs), feel free to hit up your <a class='dotted' href="https://oeh.jku.at/abschnitte/technik-und-naturwissenschaften">student union directly</a> or to contact us via [tnf@oeh.jku.at](mailto:tnf@oeh.jku.at) - we will forward you to the right people!
