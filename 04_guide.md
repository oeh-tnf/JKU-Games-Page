### Kitchen
Throughout the event, we will provide free snacks, coffee and tea in the Kitchen.<br>
A Microwave and a Fridge can be found there as well. Please sign all things you place in the fridge with your name and 
don't use the whole place for yourself. It should go without saying, but other people's stuff is off-limits.

<!--
#### Red Bull
Coffee is not for you, but you could still use a boost?<br> 
<em>Red Bull</em> has supplied us with free drinks to keep your energy up! Cans will be restocked on Saturday at the 
<em>Red Bull Power Hour</em> at 8pm.
-->

#### Pizza
Periodically, we will also organize a Pizza delivery call to <a href="https://bella-casa.at/" target="_blank">Bella Casa</a> with 
special conditions.
You will be informed about when the next order takes place at the event, we currently plan on placing orders at around 
these times: <br>

You can only pay in cash, but don't worry, there is an ATM nearby.

### Resting-Area
If you need a short break or want to recover from an intense Pen & Paper Adventure or a stressful CS-Match, you can 
chill in our Resting-Area on the second floor. Please bring your own sleeping bags or mattresses. 

## Awareness Team
Like all of our bigger events, the JKU Games makes use of Awareness Teams. Awareness Team members wear magenta high-vis vests.

Awareness Teams are here to listen to you and ensure that everyone can enjoy the event. If you don't feel comfortable 
because of a specific person or about a certain situation in our control, or if you simply want to talk, you can always 
contact a member of the Awareness Team. They will handle your request confidentially and bring up your problem anonymously 
with other relevant members of the Orga Team if necessary. We will then try to sort the issue out as quickly as possible. 
Find out more <a href="https://oeh.jku.at/en/study/technik-und-naturwissenschaften/informatik/team/awareness-teams" target="_blank">here</a>!

If you can't find an Awareness Team member, check in with the Infopoint and have them fetch one for you.

## FAQs

### Is there an entrance fee?
No, the JKU Games are a completely free event. We are entirely funded by sponsorships and via means of the student union 
(ÖH TNF). Naturally, we are always happy about any donations as well. All left-over funding will be re-invested in other 
events.

### Can I reserve a space?
There are no general reservations for our event. Given our truly massive location, we usually have enough space for you all.

Some of our activities (such as [Tournaments](/./tournaments) and [Pen and Papers](/./penandpaper)) require reservation, however. Get a free 
ticket to reserve a slot, see the respective sections for more. If you want to make sure that you will get a place for 
your PC in the LAN-Area, you can also reserve a spot [there](/./lan).

### Do I need to bring anything?
Depends on what you are up to: If you want to play Computer Games, you will have to bring your own PC and peripherals. 
We will hook you up with LAN and power - see the [LAN section](/./lan) for more details. If you are only here for the 
DICE area, you should be good, but you can bring your favorite games of course just in case we missed it.
If you plan on staying for longer, you might want to bring a bit of money for food orders, and a sleeping bag.
Most importantly, don't forget to bring your friends :P

### Can I bring alcohol?
We firmly believe that the activities offered can be enjoyed without alcohol as well. Nevertheless, we tolerate alcohol 
as long as it is not disturbing our guests and the event (see the [AGBs](/./rules) for a more binding definition). 
Naturally, all alcohol you bring is for personal consumption, please abide to rules on the protection of minors etc.

### Can I bring my dog / cat / pet hamster?
Since we are using university facilities, we have to oblige to the JKU's house rules. This means that you are unfortunately 
not allowed to bring any pets inside the building. Naturally, service animals and your computer mouse are an exception.

### Is there an age requirement?
Yes, all participants must be at least 16 years old, or have to be accompanied by a legal guardian. This is mostly due 
to the nature of our Games being an over-night event.

### Can I bring a friend?
Please do! While the event is primarily targeted at people studying or working at the JKU and at pupils considering a 
study here, your friends and family are very welcome to join as well.

### Why are you closed on Sunday Afternoon?
Throughout the last years, we have continuously extended our opening times and can provide you with almost 40 hours of 
fun. Unfortunately, since we are a team of volunteers, we are simply not able to find the people required to add an 
additional day of shifts (e.g. for our service point, game rental etc.).<br>
As you can probably imagine, it also takes quite some time to clean up after an event like ours, especially since we 
have expanded the event area quite a bit. As our locations usually need to be ready for regular university events on 
Monday, we run into problems here as well.<br>
And finally, the main organizers tend to be awake throughout most of the event - we desperately need the sleep by Sunday 
morning, I can tell you as much :P 

### Why don't you offer X and Y?
Since our resources are limited, we always have to choose carefully what to offer. If you have an idea that could fit 
our event, please don't hesitate to [contact us](/./about) - we'll try our best to implement it!<br>
The chances are even higher if you are willing to organize it yourself, so please mention this in your request as well!

Here are some common requests that we will most likely not be able to fulfill:
* Karaoke / SingStar: Too noisy
* Drinking Games: Not really in the spirit of the event
* More free snacks: We understand the desire, but we are working with a limited budget, sorry! 

### I don't feel comfortable at the event
If you don't feel comfortable because of a specific person or about a certain situation in our control, please inform us. 
We will try our best to help you out!

You can contact us via [games@oeh.jku.at](mailto:games@oeh.jku.at) or using our <a href="{{ site.discord_url }}" target="_blank">Discord Server</a>. If your 
situation is of a more private nature, please contact our Awareness Team directly - see above for more. 

### How can I help the organizers?
Since we are a team of volunteers, we are happy for any help! Please check out the [About Page](/./about) for more.

You can also help us at the event by simply cleaning up after yourself and reminding others to do the same. This way, 
we as the organizers also get more time to enjoy the event ourselves!

### The Games are over, what do I do now?!
We understand the sudden feeling of dread and despair once the JKU Games are edging closer towards their last hour. 
Fortunately, there are some other ways the spirit of the Games can stay with you until the next edition can be celebrated!
* **Game and Dine**: If you like good food and games (both the classical and especially the electronic kind), 
[Game and Dine](https://www.instagram.com/game_and_dine) has got you covered with playing nights, regulars' tables etc.! 
They are not paying us, we are just fans - say hi from us!
* **External Partners**: Some of our external partners who provided activities at the JKU Games also have their own events. [Check them out!](/./about/#external-partners)
* **JKU Gaming Discord**: If you enjoyed our Discord and are sad to see it get locked down again after the event, you can join the [JKU Gaming Community](https://discord.gg/Wfb2KbnRZV).
* **Next JKU Games**: If everything else fails, maybe the outlook for the next JKU Games can keep your hopes up: 
We are already planning to have the next Games on 05.12.-07.12.2025!
