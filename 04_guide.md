### Kitchen

Throughout the event, we will provide free snacks, coffee and tea in the Kitchen.<br>
A Microwave and a Fridge can be found there as well. Please sign all things you place in the fridge with your name and don't use the whole place for yourself. It should go without saying, but other people's stuff is off-limits.

#### Pizza
Periodically, we will also organize a Pizza delivery call to <a href="https://www.pleschinger-stube.at/">Pleschinger Stube</a> with special conditions.
You will be informed about when the next order takes place at the event, we currently plan on taking orders at around these times: <br>
* FR, 18:00
* FR, 20:00
* SA, 12:00
* SA, 18:00
* SA, 20:00

Note that this is just an approximate schedule subject to change. Check out the Pizza-Channel on <a href="{{ site.discord_url }}">Discord</a> to receive live updates.<br>
There is an ATM nearby.

#### LUI
The Linzer Uni Inn, the Student Union's bar, will be open through most of the event. They are conveniently located in the same building: You can get a drink and some snacks there as well, and play Billards or Darts. Check out their <a href="https://oeh.jku.at/abschnitte/lui">website</a> and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/LUI.LinzerUniInn">Facebook page</a> for more information.

Open on Friday, 17:00-02:00, and Saturday, 17:00-23:00 (only for the JKU GAMES).

## FAQs

### Is there an entrance fee?
No, the JKU Games are a completely free event. We are entirely funded by sponsorships and via means of the student union (ÖH TNF). Naturally, we are always happy about any donations as well. All left-over funding will be re-invested in other events.

### Can I reserve a space?
There are no general reservations for our event. Given our truly massive location, we usually have enough space for you all.

This year, we will expand our ticket system (which we used for Pen and Papers and Tournaments last semester) for the LAN-Area. This way you can be sure that you will get a place for your PC. But you can also come by chance, maybe place has become available again. Naturally, tickets are free as well.

### Do I need to bring anything?
Depends on what you are up to: If you want to play Computer Games, you will have to bring your own PC and peripherals. We will hook you up with LAN and power - see the [LAN section](/./lan) for more details. If you are only here for the DICE area, you should be good, but you can bring your favorite games of course just in case we missed it.
If you plan on staying for longer, you might want to bring a bit of money for food orders, and a sleeping bag.
Most importantly, don't forget to bring your friends :P

### Can I bring alcohol?
We firmly believe that the activities offered can be enjoyed without alcohol as well. Nevertheless, we tolerate alcohol as long as it is not disturbing our guests and the event (see the [AGBs](/./rules) for a more binding definition). Naturally, all alcohol you bring is for personal consumption, please abide to rules on the protection of minors etc.

### Can I bring my dog / cat / pet hamster?
Since we are using university facilities, we have to oblige to the JKU's house rules. This means that you are unfortunately not allowed to bring any pets inside the building. Naturally, service animals and your computer mouse are an exception.

### Is there an age requirement?
Yes, all participants must be at least 16 years old, or have to be accompanied by a legal guardian. This is mostly due to the nature of our Games being an over-night event.

### Can I bring a friend?
Please do! While the event is primarily targeted at people studying or working at the JKU and at pupils considering a study here, your friends and family are very welcome to join as well.

### Why are you closed on Sunday Afternoon?
Throughout the last years, we have continuously extended our opening times and can provide you with almost 40 hours of fun. Unfortunately, since we are a team of volunteers, we are simply not able to find the people required to add an additional day of shifts (e.g. for our service point, game rental etc).<br>
As you can probably imagine, it also takes quite some time to clean up after an event like ours, especially since we have expanded the event area quite a bit. As our locations usually need to be ready for regular university events on Monday, we run into problems here as well.<br>
And finally, the main organizers tend to be awake throughout most of the event - we desperately need the sleep by Sunday morning, I can tell you as much :P 

### Why don't you offer X and Y?
Since our resources are limited, we always have to choose carefully what to offer. If you have an idea that could fit our event, please don't hesitate to [contact us](/./about) - we'll try our best to implement it!<br>
The chances are even higher if you are willing to organize it yourself, so please mention this in your request as well!

Here are some common requests that we will most likely not be able to fulfill:
* Karaoke / SingStar: Too noisy
* Drinking Games: Not really in the spirit of the event
* More free snacks: We understand the desire, but we are working with a limited budget, sorry! 

### I don't feel comfortable at the event
If you don't feel comfortable because of a specific person or about a certain situation in our control, please inform us. We will try our best to help you out!

You can contact us via [games@oeh.jku.at](mailto:games@oeh.jku.at) or using our <a href="{{ site.discord_url }}">Discord Server</a>. If your situation is of a more private nature, please contact our Safety and Awareness Team directly - see the [About Page](/./about) for more. 

### How can I help the organizers?
Since we are a team of volunteers, we are happy for any help! Please check out the [About Page](/./about) for more.

You can also help us at the event by simply cleaning up after yourself and reminding others to do the same. This way, we as the organizers also get more time to enjoy the event ourselves!

### The Games are over, what do I do now?!
We understand the sudden feeling of dread and despair once the JKU Games are edging closer towards their last hour. Fortunately, there are some other ways the spirit of the Games can stay with you until the next edition can be celebrated!
